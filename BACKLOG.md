- [ ] remove execution logic from (what should be a passive) message class
- [X] Organize project and breakup files, create library
- [ ] Deploy into Azure
- [ ] Eliminate all link dependencies (example SecretsManager) from sdk (provide a secretsmanager interface in the sdk and then use that interface in the secretsmanager implementation)
