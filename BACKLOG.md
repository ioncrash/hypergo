- [ ] from functools import singledispatch
- [ ] low level system messages (eg. component started with hypergo version, and component version)
- [ ] version management (sdk + components)
- [ ] Components - no code execution on import
- [ ] component names should change
- [ ] component functions shouldn't be __main__
- [ ] Production roll out
- [ ] containers
- [ ] cli support and stdin binding
- [x] service bus binding for outbound
- [ ] python async await
- [ ] one click deploy
- [ ] dynamic routingkey in function
- [ ] hypergo graph
- [x] Generator (yielding) (multiple publishes)
- [ ] Python aspect orientation for logging, and exception handling
- [ ] hijacking stdout (from print) and push into logging
- [ ] Exception handling, exponential back off, etc.
- [ ] Queue management (error queues, etc)
- [ ] Logging
- [ ] Instrumentation, Monitoring
- [ ] Static graphing
- [ ] Runtime graphing
- [ ] Lineage
- [ ] routingkey boolean logic
- [ ] Context -> Message -> Payload
- [ ] Move all azure_... classes into an Azure Package and remove "azure" from their filenames (maybe?)
- [x] Create git project - Hypergo
- [x] Add gitignore
- [x] Black and other linters
- [ ] fix mypy types - add compound types to types.py (try the ai coding solution brad suggested - not phind, the other one)
- [x] remove execution logic from (what should be a passive) message class
- [x] Organize project and breakup files, create library
- [ ] Deploy into Azure
- [ ] Eliminate all link dependencies (example SecretsManager) from sdk (provide a secretsmanager interface in the sdk and then use that interface in the secretsmanager implementation)
        - have the secretsmanager inherit from dict
- [ ] Add additional message metadata to datastructures
- [ ] Separate stages: receive, unpack, consume, produce, package, send
        - [ ] conversion (eg. asb vs rmq) to Message
        - [ ] deserialize
        - [ ] validation
        - [ ] mapping in
        - [ ] execution
        - [ ] mapping out
        - [ ] validation out
        - [ ] serialize
        - [ ] convert
- [x] Black and other linters
- [ ] CICD for sdk

- [ ] In-transit data protocol
- [ ] protobuf, avro or JSONSchema validation for input and output
- [ ] Python aspect orientation for logging, and exception handling
- [ ] hijacking stdout (from print) and push into logging
- [ ] function call bus (like sqllite (But message bus))
- [ ] divergent and convergent orchestration (transactions/correlation)
- [x] pypi (internal)
- [ ] sdk build (circle?) -> pypi
- [ ] Unit tests for sdk
- [ ] Unit test pattern for component consumers of sdk
- [ ] multilanguage support (stdio bridge), service executor (not azure lambda), cli, console executor
        - [ ] support for other languages (stdio abstraction)
- [ ] amqp/rmq wrapper
- [ ] included tooling (database connectors, secrets manager, etc.) delivered through config and paramter mapping
- [x] routingkey token sorting
